Here are 11 latest RAG types:

1. InstructRAG -> 
InstructRAG: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Instruction Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning (2504.13032)

Combines RAG with a multi-agent framework, using a graph-based structure, an RL agent to expand task coverage, and a meta-learning agent for better generalization

2. CoRAG (Collaborative RAG) -> 
CoRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2504.01883)

A collaborative framework that extends RAG to settings where clients train a shared model using a joint passage store

3. ReaRAG -> 
ReaRAG: Knowledge-guided Reasoning Enhances Factuality of Large Reasoning Models with Iterative Retrieval Augmented Generation (2503.21729)

It uses a Thought-Action-Observation loop to decide at each step whether to retrieve information or finalize an answer, reducing unnecessary reasoning and errors

4. MCTS-RAG -> 
MCTS-RAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Monte Carlo Tree Search (2503.20757)

Combines RAG with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to help small LMs handle complex, knowledge-heavy tasks

5. Typed-RAG - > 
Typed-RAG: Type-aware Multi-Aspect Decomposition for Non-Factoid Question Answering (2503.15879)

Improves answers on open-ended questions by identifying question types (a debate, personal experience, or comparison) and breaking it down into simpler parts

6. MADAM-RAG -> 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Conflicting Evidence (2504.13079)

A multi-agent system where models debate answers over multiple rounds and an aggregator filters noise and misinformation

7. HM-RAG -> 
HM-RAG: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (2504.12330)

A hierarchical multi-agent RAG framework that uses 3 agents: one to split queries, one to retrieve across multiple data types (text, graphs and web), and one to merge and refine answers

8. CDF-RAG -> 
CDF-RAG: Causal Dynamic Feedback for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2504.12560)

Works with causal graphs and enables multi-hop causal reasoning, refining queries. It validates responses against causal pathways
