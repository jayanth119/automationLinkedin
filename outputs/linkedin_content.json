    "text": "Here are 11 latest RAG types:\n\n1. InstructRAG -> \nInstructRAG: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Instruction Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning (2504.13032)\n\nCombines RAG with a multi-agent framework, using a graph-based structure, an RL agent to expand task coverage, and a meta-learning agent for better generalization\n\n2. CoRAG (Collaborative RAG) -> \nCoRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2504.01883)\n\nA collaborative framework that extends RAG to settings where clients train a shared model using a joint passage store\n\n3. ReaRAG -> \nReaRAG: Knowledge-guided Reasoning Enhances Factuality of Large Reasoning Models with Iterative Retrieval Augmented Generation (2503.21729)\n\nIt uses a Thought-Action-Observation loop to decide at each step whether to retrieve information or finalize an answer, reducing unnecessary reasoning and errors\n\n4. MCTS-RAG -> \nMCTS-RAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Monte Carlo Tree Search (2503.20757)\n\nCombines RAG with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to help small LMs handle complex, knowledge-heavy tasks\n\n5. Typed-RAG - > \nTyped-RAG: Type-aware Multi-Aspect Decomposition for Non-Factoid Question Answering (2503.15879)\n\nImproves answers on open-ended questions by identifying question types (a debate, personal experience, or comparison) and breaking it down into simpler parts\n\n6. MADAM-RAG -> \nRetrieval-Augmented Generation with Conflicting Evidence (2504.13079)\n\nA multi-agent system where models debate answers over multiple rounds and an aggregator filters noise and misinformation\n\n7. HM-RAG -> \nHM-RAG: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (2504.12330)\n\nA hierarchical multi-agent RAG framework that uses 3 agents: one to split queries, one to retrieve across multiple data types (text, graphs and web), and one to merge and refine answers\n\n8. CDF-RAG -> \nCDF-RAG: Causal Dynamic Feedback for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (2504.12560)\n\nWorks with causal graphs and enables multi-hop causal reasoning, refining queries. It validates responses against causal pathways\n\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g8eGTK8P",
